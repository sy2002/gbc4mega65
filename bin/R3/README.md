### "Core does not start" bugfix (experimental)

In case you experience the "ambulance light" problem or other problems
when it comes to starting the GameBoy core, then use
`GBC4M65-devel-220517.cor`
and `GBC4M65-devel-220517.bit`.

MEGA65's reset button is disabled in this experimental core.

Caution: Only use this experimental version in case you experience problems
while starting the core. Otherwise stick with the official release.
