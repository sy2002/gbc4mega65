Roadmap / TODOs until V1.0
==========================

WIP V0.9
--------

Done in V0.9 (reminder for release notes)
-----------------------------------------

TODO until V1.0
---------------

* HyperRAM support for ROMs up to 8 MB on both machine types R2 and R3
* Support OpenEmu's Classic color schemes "Grayscale" (already supported),
  "Greenscale" and "Pocket": https://github.com/OpenEmu/Gambatte-Core/blob/master/GBGameCore.mm#L574
* Users can switch scaling between certain sizes (for example original size to 5x)
* Frame blending support
* (Internal) Update documentation to explain double buffering and frame blend
* (Internal) Enhance menu system to support checked/unchecked menu items
* MBC robustness: upgrade to newest MiSTer version and refactor MBC
* Improve SD card robustness: Check new SD card implementation
  and if better: Use it
* More convenient download of ROM: Instead of expecting cgb_bios.bin as a
  filename for the GBC BIOS, use cgb_boot.bin. This way the user does not
  need to rename it after downloading. (Maybe support both names.)
* Save games on SD card for games whose cartridges had a battery buffered RAM
  (such as the Legend of Zelda Links Awakening or Super Mario Bros. Deluxe)
* Work on current issue list on GitHub  
* Migrate to MiSTer2MEGA65
